## People

Warren McCulloch (1898 - 1969) - american neurophysiologist and cybernetician, known for his work
on certain brain theories. Along with Walter Pitts, created a computational model for the first
artificial neuron, called Threshold Logic Unit (TLU) or Linear Threshold Unit in their 1943 paper 
"A Logical Calculus of the Ideas Immanent in Nervous Activity".

Walter Pitts (1923 - 1969)  - american logician who worked in computational neuroscience. He pro-
posed landmark theoretical formulations of neural activity that influenced fields such as cognitive
science, psychology, philosophy, neuroscience, artificial intelligence, etc. He is best known for
writing along with McCulloch, "A Logical Calculus of Ideas Immanent in Nervous Activity" (1943) a
paper that proposed the first mathematical model of a neural network.

Frank Rosenblatt (1928 - 1971) - american psychologist. best known for the Perceptron, an electronic 
device which was constructed in accordance with biological principles and showed an ability to learn.

Paul Werbos (1947) - Best known for his 1974 Harvard thesis, which first described the process of 
training artificial neural networks through backpropagation of errors. He also was a pioneer of 
recurrent neural networks. http://www.werbos.com/

Arthur Samuel (1901 - 1990) - american pioneer in computer gaming and AI. Coined the term 'machine
learning'.
